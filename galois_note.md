### iff: If and only if
### *quotient group* or *factor group*
```
G = {0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5}.
N = {0, 3}
G/N = { a+N : a ∈ G } = { {0, 3}, {1, 4}, {2, 5} } = { 0+N, 1+N, 2+N }.
```

### isomorphism
```
The group of all real numbers with addition, (R,+), is isomorphic to the group of positive real numbers with multiplication (+R,×).
```


### quotient group
```
1. The kernel of φ is a normal subgroup of G,
2. The image of φ is a subgroup of H, and
3. The image of φ is isomorphic to the quotient group G / ker(φ).

### Second isomorphism theorem
```
This isomorphism theorem has been called the "diamond theorem" due to the shape of the resulting subgroup lattice with SN at the top, S⋂N at the bottom and with  N and  S to the sides.[4] It has even been called the "parallelogram theorem" because in the resulting subgroup lattice the two sides assumed to represent the quotient groups  (SN)/N  and  S/(S⋂N) are "equal" in the sense of isomorphism.

###  F(S) is called the free group generated by the set S.
### a group G is free if G ∼= F(S) for some set S.
